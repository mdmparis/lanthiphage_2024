In this Review, we argue that combining insights into actinobacterial ecology with state-of-the-art computational approaches holds great promise to unlock this unexplored reservoir of actinobacterial metabolism.

Nevertheless, natural products also present challenges for drug discovery, such as technical barriers to screening, isolation, characterization and optimization, which contributed to a decline in their pursuit by the pharmaceutical industry from the 1990s onwards. In recent years, several technological and scientific developments — including improved analytical tools, genome mining and engineering strategies, and microbial culturing advances — are addressing such challenges and opening up new opportunities. Consequently, interest in natural products as drug leads is being revitalized, particularly for tackling antimicrobial resistance. Here, we summarize recent technological developments that are enabling natural product-based drug discovery, highlight selected applications and discuss key opportunities.;2021-03;27/06/2024 07:50;27/06/2024 07:50;27/06/2024 07:50;200-216;;3;20;;Nat Rev Drug Discov;Natural products in drug discovery;;;;;;;en;2021 Springer Nature Limited;;;;www.nature.com;;Publisher: Nature Publishing Group;;C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\D983DLMH\Atanasov et al. - 2021 - Natural products in drug discovery advances and o.pdf;;;"Chemical biology; Transferases";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For all approved therapeutic agents, the time frame has been extended to cover the almost 39 years from the first of January 1981 to the 30th of September 2019 for all diseases worldwide and from ∼1946 (earliest so far identified) to the 30th of September 2019 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. As in earlier reviews, only the first approval of any drug is counted, irrespective of how many “biosimilars” or added approvals were subsequently identified. As in the 2012 and 2016 reviews, we have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a “natural product mimic”, or “NM”, to join the original primary divisions, and the designation “natural product botanical”, or “NB”, to cover those botanical “defined mixtures” now recognized as drug entities by the FDA (and similar organizations). From the data presented in this review, the utilization of natural products and/or synthetic variations using their novel structures, in order to discover and develop the final drug entity, is still alive and well. For example, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from 1946 to 1980, of the 75 small molecules, 40, or 53.3%, are N or ND. In the 1981 to date time frame the equivalent figures for the N* compounds of the 185 small molecules are 62, or 33.5%, though to these can be added the 58 S* and S*/NMs, bringing the figure to 64.9%. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked with, as expected from prior information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural products and their structures, though as can be seen in the review there are still disease areas (shown in Table 2) for which there are no drugs derived from natural products. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are still able to identify only two de novo combinatorial compounds (one of which is a little speculative) approved as drugs in this 39-year time frame, though there is also one drug that was developed using the “fragment-binding methodology” and approved in 2012. We have also added a discussion of candidate drug entities currently in clinical trials as “warheads” and some very interesting preliminary reports on sources of novel antibiotics from Nature due to the absolute requirement for new agents to combat plasmid-borne resistance genes now in the general populace. We continue to draw the attention of readers to the recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the “host from whence it was isolated”; thus we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.";27/03/2020;27/06/2024 07:50;27/06/2024 07:50;27/06/2024 07:50;770-803;;3;83;;J.

In the early years of natural product discovery from microorganisms (The Golden Age), new antibiotics were found with relative ease from low-throughput fermentation and whole cell screening methods. Later, molecular genetic and medicinal chemistry approaches were applied to modify and improve the activities of important chemical scaffolds, and more sophisticated screening methods were directed at target disease states. In the 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry moved to high-throughput screening of synthetic chemical libraries against many potential therapeutic targets, including new targets identified from the human genome sequencing project, largely to the exclusion of natural products, and discovery rates dropped dramatically. Nonetheless, natural products continued to provide key scaffolds for drug development. In the current millennium, it was discovered from genome sequencing that microbes with large genomes have the capacity to produce about ten times as many secondary metabolites as was previously recognized. Indeed, the most gifted actinomycetes have the capacity to produce around 30-50 secondary metabolites. With the precipitous drop in cost for genome sequencing, it is now feasible to sequence thousands of actinomycete genomes to identify the ""biosynthetic dark matter"" as sources for the discovery of new and novel secondary metabolites.

With the advancement in technologies, the exploitation of rich natural sources has gained exploding interest commercially to isolate natural products. During recent years, the quest for novel drugs from potentially untapped natural resources has brought man closer to nature. Microorganisms represent a vast repertoire of natural products, many of them with medicinal importance. They are renowned potential mines enriched with novel natural products needed to tackle the grim situation of antibiotic resistance worldwide.

The development of high-throughput screening methods expanded our knowledge of defence systems from a handful to more than a hundred systems, unveiling many different molecular mechanisms. These findings reveal that bacterial immunity is much more complex than previously thought. In this Review, we explore recently discovered bacterial antiphage defence systems, with a particular focus on their molecular diversity, and discuss the ecological and evolutionary drivers and implications of the existing diversity of antiphage defence mechanisms.;2023-10;27/06/2024 07:52;27/06/2024 07:52;;686-700;;10;21;;Nat Rev Microbiol;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 37460672;;;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37460672;;"Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Biological Evolution";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, the defence systems that allow bacteria to resist their phages have rarely been explored experimentally outside a very limited number of model organisms. Actinobacteria (Actinomycetota) are a phylum of GC-rich Gram-positive bacteria, which often produce an important diversity of secondary metabolites. Despite being ubiquitous in a wide range of environments, from soil to fresh and sea water but also the gut microbiome, relatively little is known about the anti-phage arsenal of Actinobacteria. In this work, we used DefenseFinder to systematically detect 131 anti-phage defence systems in 22803 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes, among which are 2253 Actinobacteria of more than 700 species. We show that, like other bacteria, Actinobacteria encode many diverse anti-phage systems that are often encoded on mobile genetic elements. We further demonstrate that most detected defence systems are absent or rarer in Actinobacteria than in other bacteria, while a few rare systems are enriched (notably gp29-gp30 and Wadjet). We characterize the spatial distribution of anti-phage systems on &#160;&#160;Streptomyces&#160;&#160; chromosomes and show that some defence systems (e.g. RM systems) tend to be encoded in the core region, while others (e.g. Lamassu and Wadjet) are enriched towards the extremities.

Previously described anti-phage systems have highly varied defence mechanisms1-11; however, all mechanisms rely on protein components to mediate defence. Here we report a chemical anti-phage defence system that is widespread in Streptomyces. We show that three naturally produced molecules that insert into DNA are able to block phage replication, whereas molecules that target DNA by other mechanisms do not. Because double-stranded DNA phages are the most numerous group in the biosphere and the production of secondary metabolites by bacteria is ubiquitous12, this mechanism of anti-phage defence probably has a major evolutionary role in shaping bacterial communities.";2018-12;27/06/2024 07:53;27/06/2024 07:53;;283-286;;7735;564;;Nature;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 30518855;;;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518855;;"Bacteriophage lambda; Bacteriophages; Biological Evolution; Daunorubicin; DNA, Viral; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Secondary Metabolism; Streptomyces; Virus Replication";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by Streptomyces, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, indicating a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, our study expands the knowledge of aminoglycoside functions, suggesting that aminoglycosides not only are used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors but also could provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level. IMPORTANCE Predation by phages is a major driver of bacterial evolution. As a result, elucidating antiphage strategies is crucial from both fundamental and therapeutic standpoints. While protein-mediated defense mechanisms, like restriction-modification systems or CRISPR/Cas, have been extensively studied, much less is known about the potential antiphage activity of small molecules. Focusing on the model bacteria Escherichia coli and Streptomyces venezuelae, our findings revealed significant antiphage properties of aminoglycosides, a major class of translation-targeting antibiotics produced by Streptomyces. Further, we demonstrate that supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers protect bacteria from phage propagation, highlighting the physiological relevance of this inhibition. Suppression of phage infection by aminoglycosides did not result from the indirect inhibition of bacterial translation, suggesting a direct interaction between aminoglycosides and phage components. This work highlights the molecular versatility of aminoglycosides, which have evolved to efficiently block protein synthesis in bacterial competitors and provide protection against phages.;04/05/2022;27/06/2024 07:54;27/06/2024 07:54;27/06/2024 07:54;e00783-22;;3;13;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;journals.asm.org (Atypon);;Publisher: American Society for Microbiology;;C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\AV2XKK74\Kever et al. - 2022 - Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Inhibit Phage Infection.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Candidate defense systems were systematically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage systems and one antiplasmid system that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include systems that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.";02/03/2018;27/06/2024 07:54;27/06/2024 07:54;;eaar4120;;6379;359;;Science;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 29371424 PMCID: PMC6387622;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\L2DLQ62H\Doron et al. - 2018 - Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems .pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371424;;"Bacillus subtilis; Bacteriophages; Escherichia coli; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Multigene Family";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These systems incorporate enzymatic activities not previously implicated in antiviral defense, including RNA editing and retron satellite DNA synthesis.

We show that the variation in secondary metabolite biosynthetic diversity drops significantly at the genus level, identifying it as an appropriate taxonomic rank for comparison. Equal comparison of genera based on relative evolutionary distance revealed that Streptomyces bacteria encode the largest biosynthetic diversity by far, with Amycolatopsis, Kutzneria and Micromonospora also encoding substantial diversity.

A substantial fraction of bacterial and archaeal genomes is dedicated to antivirus defense. We analyzed the distribution of defense genes and typical mobilome components (such as viral and transposon genes) in bacterial and archaeal genomes and demonstrated statistically significant clustering of antivirus defense systems and mobile genes and elements in genomic islands. The defense islands are enriched in putative operons and contain numerous overrepresented gene families. A detailed sequence analysis of the proteins encoded by genes in these families shows that many of them are diverged variants of known defense system components, whereas others show features, such as characteristic operonic organization, that are suggestive of novel defense systems. Thus, genomic islands provide abundant material for the experimental study of bacterial and archaeal antivirus defense. Except for the CRISPR-Cas systems, different classes of defense systems, in particular toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification systems, show nonrandom clustering in defense islands. It remains unclear to what extent these associations reflect functional cooperation between different defense systems and to what extent the islands are genomic “sinks” that accumulate diverse nonessential genes, particularly those acquired via horizontal gene transfer. The characteristics of defense islands resemble those of mobilome islands. Defense and mobilome genes are nonrandomly associated in islands, suggesting nonadaptive evolution of the islands via a preferential attachment-like mechanism underpinned by the addictive properties of defense systems such as toxins-antitoxins and an important role of horizontal mobility in the evolution of these islands.;12/10/2011;27/06/2024 07:56;27/06/2024 07:56;27/06/2024 07:56;6039-6056;;21;193;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;journals.asm.org (Atypon);;Publisher: American Society for Microbiology;;C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\4F78EXNH\Makarova et al. - 2011 - Defense Islands in Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes .pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A community-driven review in 2013 described the emerging commonalities in the biosynthesis of RiPPs and the opportunities they offered for bioengineering and genome mining. Since then, the field has seen tremendous advances in understanding of the mechanisms by which nature assembles these compounds, in engineering their biosynthetic machinery for a wide range of applications, and in the discovery of entirely new RiPP families using bioinformatic tools developed specifically for this compound class. The First International Conference on RiPPs was held in 2019, and the meeting participants assembled the current review describing new developments since 2013. The review discusses the new classes of RiPPs that have been discovered, the advances in our understanding of the installation of both primary and secondary post-translational modifications, and the mechanisms by which the enzymes recognize the leader peptides in their substrates.

They are derived from precursor polypeptides whose modification by various dedicated enzymes helps to establish a vast array of chemical motifs. RiPPs have attracted much interest as a source of potential therapeutic agents, and in particular as alternatives to conventional antibiotics to address the bacterial resistance crisis. However, their ecological roles in nature are poorly understood and explored. The present review describes major RiPP actors in competition within microbial communities, the main ecological and physiological functions currently evidenced for RiPPs, and the microbial ecosystems that are the sites for these functions. We envision that the study of RiPPs may lead to discoveries of new biological functions and highlight that a better knowledge of how bacterial RiPPs mediate inter-/intraspecies and interkingdom interactions will hold promise for devising alternative strategies in antibiotic development.;03/01/2020;27/06/2024 07:57;27/06/2024 07:57;27/06/2024 07:57;34-54;;1;295;;J Biol Chem;;;;;;;;;;;;;PubMed Central;;PMID: 31784450 PMCID: PMC6952617;;"C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\6UE8I76T\Rebuffat - 2020 - The manifold roles of microbial ribosomal peptide–.pdf; ";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952617/;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The genes that encode these pathways are often organised into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In 2015, we defined the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG): a standardised data format that describes the minimally required information to uniquely characterise a BGC. We simultaneously constructed an accompanying online database of BGCs, which has since been widely used by the community as a reference dataset for BGCs and was expanded to 2021 entries in 2019 (MIBiG 2.0). Here, we describe MIBiG 3.0, a database update comprising large-scale validation and re-annotation of existing entries and 661 new entries. Particular attention was paid to the annotation of compound structures and biological activities, as well as protein domain selectivities. Together, these new features keep the database up-to-date, and will provide new opportunities for the scientific community to use its freely available data, e.g. for the training of new machine learning models to predict sequence-structure-function relationships for diverse natural products.

Lanthipeptides that display antimicrobial activity are called lantibiotics. The post-translational modification reactions of lanthipeptides include dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, a transformation that is carried out in three unique ways in different classes of lanthipeptides. In a cyclization process, Cys residues then attack the dehydrated residues to generate the lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether cross-linked amino acids from which lanthipeptides derive their name. The resulting polycyclic peptides have constrained conformations that confer their biological activities. After installation of the characteristic thioether cross-links, tailoring enzymes introduce additional post-translational modifications that are unique to each lanthipeptide and that fine-tune their activities and/or stability. This review focuses on studies published over the past decade that have provided much insight into the mechanisms of the enzymes that carry out the post-translational modifications.;26/04/2017;27/06/2024 07:58;27/06/2024 07:58;27/06/2024 07:58;5457-5520;;8;117;;Chem Rev;;;;;;;;;;;;;PubMed Central;;PMID: 28135077 PMCID: PMC5408752;;"C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\HDFHZS4B\Repka et al. - 2017 - Mechanistic Understanding of Lanthipeptide Biosynt.pdf; ";https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5408752/;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the advances in DNA sequencing technologies and genome mining tools, new biosynthetic enzymes capable of installing unusual structural features are continuously being discovered. In this study, we investigated an O-methyltransferase that is a member of the most prominent auxiliary enzyme family associated with class I lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters. Despite the prevalence of these enzymes, their function has not been established. Herein, we demonstrate that the O-methyltransferase OlvSA encoded in the olv gene cluster from Streptomyces olivaceus NRRL B-3009 catalyzes the rearrangement of a highly conserved aspartate residue to a β-amino acid, isoaspartate, in the lanthipeptide OlvA(BCSA). We elucidated the NMR solution structure of the GluC-digested peptide, OlvA(BCSA)GluC, which revealed a unique ring topology comprising four interlocking rings and positions the isoaspartate residue in a solvent exposed loop that is stabilized by a MeLan ring. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis further indicated that OlvA(BCSA) contains two dl-MeLan rings and two Lan rings with an unusual ll-stereochemistry. Lastly, in vitro reconstitution of OlvSA activity showed that it is a leader peptide-independent and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that mediates the conversion of a highly conserved aspartate residue in a cyclic substrate into a succinimide, which is hydrolyzed to generate an Asp or isoAsp containing peptide. This overall transformation converts an α-amino acid into a β-amino acid in a ribosomally synthesized peptide, via an electrophilic intermediate that may be the intended product.;23/10/2019;27/06/2024 07:59;27/06/2024 07:59;;16790-16801;;42;141;;J Am Chem Soc;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 31568727 PMCID: PMC6812601;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\WV279NUT\Acedo et al. - 2019 - O-Methyltransferase-Mediated Incorporation of a β-.pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568727;;"Alanine; Amino Acid Sequence; Biocatalysis; Imides; Methyltransferases; Models, Molecular; Peptides; Protein Conformation; Streptomyces; Sulfides";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To take full advantage of this treasure trove of bioactive molecules, better genetic tools are required for the genetic engineering and synthetic biology of Streptomyces. We therefore developed CUBIC, a novel CUmate-Based Inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system that allows highly efficient and inducible gene knockdown in Streptomyces. Its broad application is shown by the specific and nondisruptive knockdown of genes involved in growth, development and antibiotic production in various Streptomyces species. To facilitate hyper-efficient plasmid construction, we adapted the Golden Gate assembly to achieve 100% cloning efficiency of the protospacers. We expect that the versatile plug-and-play CUBIC system will create new opportunities for research and innovation in the field of Streptomyces.;20/10/2023;27/06/2024 07:59;27/06/2024 07:59;;3143-3147;;10;12;;ACS Synth Biol;CUBIC;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 37801665 PMCID: PMC10594651;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\4X6M4E5P\Bai et van Wezel - 2023 - CUBIC A Versatile Cumate-Based Inducible CRISPRi .pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37801665;;"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; CRISPR interference; cumate inducible promoter; Genetic Engineering; Humans; natural products; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Streptomyces; synthetic biology";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, how interspecies cues are sensed and ultimately lead to induction of specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters remains largely unexplored. Using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), we analyzed genes that were transcriptionally induced in the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor during interactions with four different actinomycetes, including genes that encode unusual regulatory systems known as conservons. Deletions in one such system, encoded by the cvn8 genes, led to altered patterns of pigmented antibiotic production by S. coelicolor during interactions. Further transcriptomic analysis of mutants lacking each of the five genes in the cvn8 locus demonstrated that this system is a global regulator of at least four different specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways. How conservon systems work at the mechanistic level to regulate gene expression is not well understood, although it has been hypothesized that they may function in a way similar to eukaryotic G-protein-coupled receptors. The data presented here indicate that the gene products of the cvnA8 and cvnF8 (SCO6939) genes likely function together in one part of the Cvn8 signaling cascade, while the cvnC8 and cvnD8 gene products likely function together in another part. Importantly, because cvnD8 likely encodes a Ras-like GTPase, these results connect G-protein-mediated signaling to gene regulation in a bacterium. Additionally, deletion of any of the cvn8 genes led to abnormally high expression of an adjacent cryptic lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene cluster, indicating that conservon systems may be fruitful targets for manipulation to activate silent specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways. IMPORTANCE Interactions between different species of actinomycete bacteria often trigger one of the strains to produce specialized metabolites, such as antibiotics. However, how this induction occurs at the genetic level is poorly understood. Using transcriptomic methods, we show that an unusual regulatory system, known as a conservon system, is responsible for regulating expression of multiple specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in the organism Streptomyces coelicolor during interactions. Conservon systems are unusual because they appear to employ small GTPases as an important component of their signaling cascades. Small GTPases are common in eukaryotic signaling pathways, but the results presented here are notable since they implicate a system that includes a small GTPase in global gene regulation in a bacterium. Mutants lacking this conservon system also showed abnormally high expression of a gene cluster involved in making an unknown specialized metabolite, suggesting that conservon mutants might be useful for driving natural product discovery.;12/10/2021;27/06/2024 07:59;27/06/2024 07:59;27/06/2024 07:59;10.1128/msystems.00281-21;;5;6;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;journals.asm.org (Atypon);;Publisher: American Society for Microbiology;;C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\3V4VALVP\Bonet et al. - 2021 - The cvn8 Conservon System Is a Global Regulator of.pdf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although the mechanism of defense for some of these systems is understood, a major unanswered question is how these systems sense phage infection. To systematically address this question, we isolated 177 phage mutants that escape 15 different defense systems. In many cases, these escaper phages were mutated in the gene sensed by the defense system, enabling us to map the phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immunity. Our data identify specificity determinants of diverse retron systems and reveal phage-encoded triggers for multiple abortive infection systems. We find general themes in phage sensing and demonstrate that mechanistically diverse systems have converged to sense either the core replication machinery of the phage, phage structural components, or host takeover mechanisms. Combining our data with previous findings, we formulate key principles on how bacterial immune systems sense phage invaders.;27/04/2023;27/06/2024 08:01;27/06/2024 08:01;;1863-1876.e16;;9;186;;Cell;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 37030292;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\NLKDAU3S\Stokar-Avihail et al. - 2023 - Discovery of phage determinants that confer sensit.pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37030292;;"abortive infection; anti-phage; Bacteria; bacterial defense; bacterial immunity; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Bacteriophages; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Ec48; Ec67; Eco8; escaper phages; msDNA; Mutation; phage escape; phage resistance; phage sensitivity determinants; phage triggers; RecBCD; retron; Viral Proteins";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These phages encode a single-subunit RNA polymerase for transcription of their late (structure- and lysis-associated) genes, whereas the bacterial RNA polymerase is used at the earlier stages of infection. Rac mediates the inactivation of bacterial transcription by introducing a specific cleavage in the α subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase. This cleavage occurs within the flexible linker sequence and disconnects the C-terminal domain, required for transcription initiation from most highly active cellular promoters. To achieve this, Rac likely taps into a novel post-translational modification (PTM) mechanism within the host Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From an evolutionary perspective, this novel phage-encoded regulation mechanism confirms the importance of PTMs in the prokaryotic metabolism and represents a new way by which phages can hijack the bacterial host metabolism.;02/09/2020;27/06/2024 08:01;27/06/2024 08:01;;976;;9;12;;Viruses;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 32887488 PMCID: PMC7552054;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\WDRTD59N\Ceyssens et al. - 2020 - The Phage-Encoded N-Acetyltransferase Rac Mediates.pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887488;;"Acetyltransferases; Bacterial Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; host transcriptional shutdown; Host-Pathogen Interactions; phage-induced acetylation; phage–host interactions; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Phages; Transcription, Genetic; Viral Proteins";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.";15/07/2002;27/06/2024 08:07;27/06/2024 08:07;;3059-3066;;14;30;;Nucleic Acids Res;MAFFT;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 12136088 PMCID: PMC135756;;"; C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\M5E4BPTJ\Katoh et al. - 2002 - MAFFT a novel method for rapid multiple sequence .pdf";http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12136088;;"Computer Simulation; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Ribosomal; Sequence Alignment; Software; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.;20/10/2011;27/06/2024 08:07;27/06/2024 08:07;27/06/2024 08:07;e1002195;;10;7;;PLOS Computational Biology;;;;;;;;en;;;;;PLoS Journals;;Publisher: Public Library of Science;;C:\Users\flori\Zotero\storage\9URJZIN5\Eddy - 2011 - Accelerated Profile HMM Searches.pdf;;;"BLAST algorithm; Computational pipelines; Computer software; Database searching; Heuristic alignment procedure; Hidden Markov models; Multiple alignment calculation; Sequence alignment";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sequence logos provide a richer and more precise description of sequence similarity than consensus sequences and can rapidly reveal significant features of the alignment otherwise difficult to perceive. Each logo consists of stacks of letters, one stack for each position in the sequence. The overall height of each stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position (measured in bits), whereas the height of symbols within the stack reflects the relative frequency of the corresponding amino or nucleic acid at that position. WebLogo has been enhanced recently with additional features and options, to provide a convenient and highly configurable sequence logo generator.

Transfer functions need to be supplied in trans by the E. coli donor strain. We have incorporated into these vectors selectable antibiotic-resistance markers (AmR, ThR, SpR) that function in Streptomyces spp. and other features that should allow for: (i) integration via homologous recombination between cloned DNA and the Streptomyces spp. chromosome, (ii) autonomous replication, or (iii) site-specific integration at the bacteriophage phi C31 attachment site. Shuttle cosmids for constructing genomic libraries and bacteriophage P1 cloning vector capable of accepting approx. 100-kb fragments are also described. A simple mating procedure has been developed for the conjugal transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Streptomyces spp. that involves plating of the donor strain and either germinated spores or mycelial fragments of the recipient strain. We have shown that several of these vectors can be introduced into Streptomyces fradiae, a strain that is notoriously difficult to transform by PEG-mediated protoplast transformation.;01/07/1992;27/06/2024 08:08;27/06/2024 08:08;;43-49;;1;116;;Gene;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 1628843;;;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1628843;;"Bacteriophages; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Conjugation, Genetic; DNA, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Genetic Markers; Genetic Vectors; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Recombination, Genetic; Restriction Mapping; Streptomyces";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SepF aligns FtsZ polymers and also acts as a membrane anchor for the Z-ring. While in most bacteria cell division takes place at midcell, during sporulation of Streptomyces many septa are laid down almost simultaneously in multinucleoid aerial hyphae. The genomes of streptomycetes encode two additional SepF paralogs, SflA and SflB, which can interact with SepF. Here we show that the sporogenic aerial hyphae of sflA and sflB mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor frequently branch, a phenomenon never seen in the wild-type strain. The branching coincided with ectopic localization of DivIVA along the lateral wall of sporulating aerial hyphae. Constitutive expression of SflA and SflB largely inhibited hyphal growth, further correlating SflAB activity to that of DivIVA. SflAB localized in foci prior to and after the time of sporulation-specific cell division, while SepF co-localized with active septum synthesis. Foci of FtsZ and DivIVA frequently persisted between adjacent spores in spore chains of sflA and sflB mutants, at sites occupied by SflAB in wild-type cells. Taken together, our data show that SflA and SflB play an important role in the control of growth and cell division during Streptomyces development.;19/02/2023;27/06/2024 08:08;27/06/2024 08:08;;79-87;;;645;;Biochem Biophys Res Commun;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;;PMID: 36680940;;;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36680940;;"Actinobacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Division; Cytokinesis; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Development; Divisome; Protein-protein interactions; Spores, Bacterial; Sporulation-specific cell division; Streptomyces; Streptomyces coelicolor";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YA7XKWI2;journalArticle;2020;"Srivastava, Avi; Malik, Laraib; Sarkar, Hirak; Patro, Rob";A Bayesian framework for inter-cellular information sharing improves dscRNA-seq quantification;Bioinformatics (Oxford, England);;1367-4811;10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa450;;MOTIVATION: Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data are being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene-level abundances for each cell is a crucial first step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When pre-processing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3' sampling bias, makes it difficult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes. RESULTS: We introduce a Bayesian framework for information sharing across cells within a sample, or across multiple modalities of data using the same sample, to improve gene quantification estimates for dscRNA-seq data. We use an anchor-based approach to connect cells with similar gene-expression patterns, and learn informative, empirical priors which we provide to alevin's gene multi-mapping resolution algorithm. This improves the quantification estimates for genes with no uniquely mapping reads (i.e. when there is no unique intra-cellular information). We show our new model improves the per cell gene-level estimates and provides a principled framework for information sharing across multiple modalities. We test our method on a combination of simulated and real datasets under various setups. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The information sharing model is included in alevin and is implemented in C++14.
